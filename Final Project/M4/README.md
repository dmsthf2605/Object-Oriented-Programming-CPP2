1. Split Task.cpp into t-test.cpp, t.h, t.cpp.  File t-test.cpp contains main and the t.h/t.cpp file pair contains class TaskManager and class Task. This is essentially the same process we used to split taskreader.cpp into taskdump.cpp, util.h and util.cpp.  Program t-test and task should do the same thing.  We didnâ€™t write any new code or change any of the existing code.  All we did is move the code around between three files.
2. Similarily split item.cpp into i-test.cpp, i.h and i.cpp. 
3. Also split order.cpp into o-test.cpp o.h and o.cpp. 
4. Create a new program iot.cpp.  This program reads all three data files.  Essentially, t-test.cpp, i-test.cpp, nd o-test.cpp are merged into iot.cpp. 
5. Referential integrity (consistency) checking.
